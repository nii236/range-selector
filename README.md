# range-selector

I was really frustated with the state of time pickers. Until now!

Instead of messing with:

* Sliders
* Text input
* Clicking on arrows
* Context switching constantly between clicking, typing and dragging

This component lets you draw your time range and be done with it.

# Installation

```
git clone git@github.com:nii236/range-selector.git
cd range-selector
yarn
yarn run storybook
```
